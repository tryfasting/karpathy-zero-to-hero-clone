[Chorus]
I like my girls pretty, so fine
One plus the nine
How you get me goin', might just blow it
I like my girls pretty in the face
Art piece to frame
Mona, Mona Lisa, yeah, I need ya
I like my girls

[Post-Chorus]
Lookin' just like a paintin'
Don't need no validation
Pretty, so fine
One plus the nine
How you get me goin', might just blow it
I like my girls (Uh-huh)
I like my girls (I like, I like)
I like my girls

[Verse]
Independent check (Check)
Got her own check (Check)
By the way you look, yeah, you 'bout to cause a wreck
Yeah, she know I'm on the move
I can't stop, I'm up next
But she hold me down
She's so sexy, I'm obsessed, yeah
Toes all in the sand, come and walk with me (Walk it, walk it)
Love the way you take the stress and Louis off of me (Of me)
'Cause she bad and she know it, yeah, that's all I need
Earring with the diamond match her smile, yeah, she sparklin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you got me all in
Bad, bad, bad, I know your exes callin'
The way you look, I understand the hype
You know you're just my type
Gotta, gotta get ya 'cause you know just what I like

[Chorus]
I like my girls pretty, so fine
One plus the nine
How you get me goin', might just blow it
I like my girls pretty in the face
Art piece to frame

[Post-Chorus]
Lookin' just like a paintin'
Don't need no validation
Pretty, so fine
One plus the nine
How you get me goin', might just blow it
